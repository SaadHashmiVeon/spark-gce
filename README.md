Spark GCE
=========

Spark GCE is like Spark Ec2 but for those who run their cluster on Google Cloud.  

  - Make Sure you have installed and authenticated gcutils where you are running this script.
  - Helps you launch a spark cluster in the Google Cloud
  - Attaches 500GB empty disk to all nodes in the cluster
  - Installs and Configures everything Automatically
  - Starts the Shark server Automatically

Spark GCE is a python script which will help you launch a spark cluster in the google cloud like the way spark_ec2 script does for AWS.
